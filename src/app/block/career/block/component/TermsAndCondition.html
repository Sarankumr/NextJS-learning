<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Your Use of the Services</h2>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.1 Using Glassdoor Services</h3>
<p>Glassdoor offers a variety of services that may change from time to time, at our sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Whether or not you&rsquo;ve set up an account on our services, if you use our services we may process your personal data. We describe how we may use your personal data in our&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/glassdoor">Privacy Policy</a>. This includes personal data we use to offer or provide our services to you, our customers, other users, and the public, as well as to manage and improve our services. We also collect and share personal data with third party service providers acting on our behalf, including providers of analytics services that may record or log your activities on our services, including text you enter, pages you visit, and features you interact with. By using our services, you agree to this data processing and sharing.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We may offer you the ability to create and/or join groups to have conversations and create communities with other users (also known as &ldquo;bowls&rdquo;). Groups may have managers or leaders (also known as &ldquo;community&rdquo; or &ldquo;bowl leaders&rdquo;) who have access to additional features for managing their groups (e.g., the ability to pin or highlight Content or approve new members). Leading a group is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the services. We are not responsible for actions taken by group leaders. Group leaders are not, and may not represent that they are, authorised to act on behalf of Glassdoor. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user&rsquo;s ability to lead a group at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for breaching these Terms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We may provide you with the ability to research jobs, including via search functionality and through personalised ads and recommendations. We may also allow you to submit job applications via our services. We work with&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands">our affiliates</a>&nbsp;to provide this service. When you click the apply (or a similar) button to submit an application, your application is sent to the most appropriate contact information we and/or our affiliates have on file for that employer.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>While we and our affiliates endeavor to make this service the best it can be, employer websites and their service providers are not controlled by us, and we cannot guarantee that your application will be properly received and logged by any third-party employer upon transmission. If you have any reason to think your application was not received by an employer, we suggest you contact them directly to confirm.</li>
<li>Glassdoor does not guarantee the identity of an employer or any individuals working for any employers, and therefore advises users to exercise caution when applying to jobs. Glassdoor does not guarantee the validity of a job offer; users should verify the validity of a job offer before taking adverse action regarding their current employment situations. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any employer or job offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Personalization of your Glassdoor experience may vary depending on how you use our services and if you have registered for an account. When available, we will use your location, your Profile, and your activity on our services (e.g., pages you view, Content you interact with, jobs you search for) to personalize your experience. To learn more about which information we collect and how we use it, please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/glassdoor">Privacy Policy</a>. You cannot opt out of or adjust these personalization features absent deleting your account or information from your Profile. The most important factors for personalization include your location and your Profile. We may use your personal information and activity to personalize:
<ul>
<li>The jobs we recommend to you or show you in search results;</li>
<li>The groups, people, or Content we recommend you join or view; and</li>
<li>The advertisements we show you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.2 Anonymity And Identity On Glassdoor</h3>
<p>Depending on the services you use, we may offer you different options for controlling how your personal data and identity are represented to other users, employers, and the public.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A portion of your Profile on our community and conversation services (e.g., Fishbowl and community and conversation features across our services) is always public. Therefore, your profile picture, company name, title, and other general information (but not including your semi-/anonymous Content submissions) will be visible to the public and available via search. Content submitted with semi-/anonymous identifiers such as your company name or job title is not associated with the publicly-visible portion of your Profile.</li>
<li>When you submit Content such as a post, comment, or question, you may be able to control how you represent yourself using different anonymity options. For example, when using some of our services, you can choose to submit Content with your company name, your job title, or your full name.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When submitting other Content, such as reviews, you may be required to include certain personal data for public display, such as your employer, job title, and/or location.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In some groups, we may allow you to make your Profile visible to other members of the group so you can interact with them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In some instances, we may allow group leaders to limit access to a group and approve new group members. When you request access to a group, your Profile and answers to member-approval questions may be shared with the leader(s) for that group.</li>
<li>We endeavor to offer opportunities to use our services while preserving your anonymity, However, you acknowledge that Glassdoor cannot guarantee your anonymity as, depending on your specific situation and circumstances and the contents of your Content, even semi-/anonymous identifiers, such as company or job title, especially when paired with other information such as your location, may allow someone to identify you or narrow down your identity to a small group of people (e.g., employees in a particular department at your company). You should understand this risk before submitting Content to the services.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.3 House Rules&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You represent and warrant that you will use the services solely for lawful purposes in a manner consistent with these Terms and any and all applicable laws, regulations, or other legally enforceable obligations (including contractual obligations) you may have towards us and/or any third parties.&nbsp;</p>

You and your Promotion must state that the Promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Glassdoor or our services. You acknowledge and agree that we will not assist you in any way with your Promotion, and you agree to conduct your Promotion at your own risk.

</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">12.1 Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If either of us intends to seek arbitration under this section, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating arbitration.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">12.2 Binding Arbitration Agreement, Exceptions to Arbitration, Governing Law &amp; Venue</h3>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.1 Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action/Class Arbitration Waiver.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4 below, you and Glassdoor each agree that any and all disputes between Glassdoor and consumer (i.e., non-business/commercial) users arising under or related in any way to these Terms and/or your use of our services (and which are not otherwise resolved pursuant to section 12.1) must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in section 12.2. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate set forth in section 12.2 is unenforceable, the remainder of section 12 of these Terms will nevertheless still apply (including the prohibition on class arbitration).</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.2 Arbitration Procedure.&nbsp;</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Any arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (<strong>&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;</strong>), if applicable, as modified by this section. The AAA&rsquo;s rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Any settlement offer made by you or Glassdoor shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Unless otherwise required by the applicable arbitration rules, the arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, you and Glassdoor may elect to have the arbitration conducted by audio and/or a video communication system (including, but not limited to telephone conference or a video conference platform such as Zoom) or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Glassdoor subject to the arbitrator&rsquo;s discretion to require an in-person hearing. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or Glassdoor may attend by audio and/or a video communication system (including, but not limited to telephone conference or a video conference platform such as Zoom), unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognised principles of equality, and will honor all claims of privilege recognised by law.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.3 Opt-Out Procedure.&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (&ldquo;OPT-OUT&rdquo;) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (&ldquo;OPT-OUT NOTICE&rdquo;). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO GLASSDOOR LLC., C/O CT CORPORATION, ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 330 NORTH BRAND BOULEVARD, GLENDALE, CA 91203-2336.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For your convenience, we are providing an&nbsp;<a href="http://media.glassdoor.com/legal/Glassdoor-Arbitration-Opt-Out-Notice.pdf">Opt-Out Notice form</a>&nbsp;that you may use. Please make sure to include your name, address (street address, city, state, and zip code), and the email address(es) associated with the account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in section 12.2. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in this section, all other parts of these Terms and section 12 will continue to apply to you. Opting out of the agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may enter into or have entered into with us.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.4 Exceptions to Arbitration.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The agreement to arbitration provisions set forth in subparts 12.2.1 and 12.2.2 above will not apply to the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>small claims court cases that qualify for small claims status;</li>
<li>legal proceedings or procedures that involve efforts to obtain personal data related to a user or users, including but not limited to the author of any Glassdoor Content or review;</li>
<li>any legal proceedings brought against any of the Glassdoor Group by companies or other legal entities, or individuals acting on behalf of such companies or other legal entities;</li>
<li>any legal proceedings brought by any of the Glassdoor Group against companies or other legal entities, or individuals acting on behalf of any such companies or other legal entities; and</li>
<li>a party&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>any claim for public injunctive relief, which must be adjudicated in court, not by the arbitrator. If either party seeks public injunctive relief, that request for relief shall be severed from any arbitration proceeding and stayed pending a final resolution of the arbitration, at which point the claim may be adjudicated.</li>
<li>any claim not already subject to one of the exceptions listed in section 12.2.4 where any or all of the non-Glassdoor Group parties are located outside of the United States.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, for some reason, the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in section 12 cannot be enforced, then the entirety of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in subparts 12.2.1-3 will not apply; the remainder of section 12 will continue to apply.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.5 Governing Law and Venue.</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For claims subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4, these Terms and any and all claims, disputes, or other legal proceedings by or between you or us, including but not limited to any such claims or disputes that are in any way related to or arising under these Terms or your access to or use of our services, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may otherwise provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. These claims or disputes shall be brought and litigated exclusively in the state courts located within Marin County, California or the federal courts in the Northern District of California, as appropriate, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of each of these courts for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.</li>
<li>For all claims not subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4, the parties agree that their arrangement under these Terms is in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies to the construction of the agreement to arbitrate provisions set forth in section 12.2.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.6 Changes To The Agreement To Arbitrate</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We will notify you of changes to section 12 by posting the changes at least 30 days before the effective date of the changes and by notice to the email address associated with your account. It is therefore essential that you keep your email address up to date. You can update your email address from your accounts settings page.</li>
<li>If you do not agree to the changed terms, you may close your account within the 30 day period and you will not be bound by these changes. Otherwise, if you continue to use our services, the changed terms will apply to all disputes or claims governed by this section 12 that have arisen or may arise between you and Glassdoor which are initiated after the time the changed terms take effect.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any changes to section 12 (other than a change to any referenced notice address or site links) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding prior to the effective date of the change.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Your Use of the Services</h2>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.1 Using Glassdoor Services</h3>
<p>Glassdoor offers a variety of services that may change from time to time, at our sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Whether or not you&rsquo;ve set up an account on our services, if you use our services we may process your personal data. We describe how we may use your personal data in our&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/glassdoor">Privacy Policy</a>. This includes personal data we use to offer or provide our services to you, our customers, other users, and the public, as well as to manage and improve our services. We also collect and share personal data with third party service providers acting on our behalf, including providers of analytics services that may record or log your activities on our services, including text you enter, pages you visit, and features you interact with. By using our services, you agree to this data processing and sharing.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We may offer you the ability to create and/or join groups to have conversations and create communities with other users (also known as &ldquo;bowls&rdquo;). Groups may have managers or leaders (also known as &ldquo;community&rdquo; or &ldquo;bowl leaders&rdquo;) who have access to additional features for managing their groups (e.g., the ability to pin or highlight Content or approve new members). Leading a group is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the services. We are not responsible for actions taken by group leaders. Group leaders are not, and may not represent that they are, authorised to act on behalf of Glassdoor. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user&rsquo;s ability to lead a group at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for breaching these Terms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We may provide you with the ability to research jobs, including via search functionality and through personalised ads and recommendations. We may also allow you to submit job applications via our services. We work with&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands">our affiliates</a>&nbsp;to provide this service. When you click the apply (or a similar) button to submit an application, your application is sent to the most appropriate contact information we and/or our affiliates have on file for that employer.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>While we and our affiliates endeavor to make this service the best it can be, employer websites and their service providers are not controlled by us, and we cannot guarantee that your application will be properly received and logged by any third-party employer upon transmission. If you have any reason to think your application was not received by an employer, we suggest you contact them directly to confirm.</li>
<li>Glassdoor does not guarantee the identity of an employer or any individuals working for any employers, and therefore advises users to exercise caution when applying to jobs. Glassdoor does not guarantee the validity of a job offer; users should verify the validity of a job offer before taking adverse action regarding their current employment situations. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any employer or job offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Personalization of your Glassdoor experience may vary depending on how you use our services and if you have registered for an account. When available, we will use your location, your Profile, and your activity on our services (e.g., pages you view, Content you interact with, jobs you search for) to personalize your experience. To learn more about which information we collect and how we use it, please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/glassdoor">Privacy Policy</a>. You cannot opt out of or adjust these personalization features absent deleting your account or information from your Profile. The most important factors for personalization include your location and your Profile. We may use your personal information and activity to personalize:
<ul>
<li>The jobs we recommend to you or show you in search results;</li>
<li>The groups, people, or Content we recommend you join or view; and</li>
<li>The advertisements we show you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.2 Anonymity And Identity On Glassdoor</h3>
<p>Depending on the services you use, we may offer you different options for controlling how your personal data and identity are represented to other users, employers, and the public.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A portion of your Profile on our community and conversation services (e.g., Fishbowl and community and conversation features across our services) is always public. Therefore, your profile picture, company name, title, and other general information (but not including your semi-/anonymous Content submissions) will be visible to the public and available via search. Content submitted with semi-/anonymous identifiers such as your company name or job title is not associated with the publicly-visible portion of your Profile.</li>
<li>When you submit Content such as a post, comment, or question, you may be able to control how you represent yourself using different anonymity options. For example, when using some of our services, you can choose to submit Content with your company name, your job title, or your full name.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When submitting other Content, such as reviews, you may be required to include certain personal data for public display, such as your employer, job title, and/or location.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In some groups, we may allow you to make your Profile visible to other members of the group so you can interact with them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In some instances, we may allow group leaders to limit access to a group and approve new group members. When you request access to a group, your Profile and answers to member-approval questions may be shared with the leader(s) for that group.</li>
<li>We endeavor to offer opportunities to use our services while preserving your anonymity, However, you acknowledge that Glassdoor cannot guarantee your anonymity as, depending on your specific situation and circumstances and the contents of your Content, even semi-/anonymous identifiers, such as company or job title, especially when paired with other information such as your location, may allow someone to identify you or narrow down your identity to a small group of people (e.g., employees in a particular department at your company). You should understand this risk before submitting Content to the services.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.3 House Rules&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You represent and warrant that you will use the services solely for lawful purposes in a manner consistent with these Terms and any and all applicable laws, regulations, or other legally enforceable obligations (including contractual obligations) you may have towards us and/or any third parties.&nbsp;</p>

You and your Promotion must state that the Promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Glassdoor or our services. You acknowledge and agree that we will not assist you in any way with your Promotion, and you agree to conduct your Promotion at your own risk.

</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 12 CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

YOU AND GLASSDOOR AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</strong></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">12.1 Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If either of us intends to seek arbitration under this section, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating arbitration.

You may download or copy a form Notice&nbsp;<a href="http://media.glassdoor.com/legal/Glassdoor-Notice-of-Dispute.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>During the 30 day period, you and we agree to act in good faith to resolve the dispute. If you and Glassdoor cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Glassdoor may commence formal proceedings in accordance with section 12.2.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">12.2 Binding Arbitration Agreement, Exceptions to Arbitration, Governing Law &amp; Venue</h3>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.1 Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action/Class Arbitration Waiver.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4 below, you and Glassdoor each agree that any and all disputes between Glassdoor and consumer (i.e., non-business/commercial) users arising under or related in any way to these Terms and/or your use of our services (and which are not otherwise resolved pursuant to section 12.1) must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in section 12.2. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate set forth in section 12.2 is unenforceable, the remainder of section 12 of these Terms will nevertheless still apply (including the prohibition on class arbitration).</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.2 Arbitration Procedure.&nbsp;</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Any arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (<strong>&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;</strong>), if applicable, as modified by this section. The AAA&rsquo;s rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Any settlement offer made by you or Glassdoor shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Unless otherwise required by the applicable arbitration rules, the arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, you and Glassdoor may elect to have the arbitration conducted by audio and/or a video communication system (including, but not limited to telephone conference or a video conference platform such as Zoom) or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Glassdoor subject to the arbitrator&rsquo;s discretion to require an in-person hearing. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or Glassdoor may attend by audio and/or a video communication system (including, but not limited to telephone conference or a video conference platform such as Zoom), unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognised principles of equality, and will honor all claims of privilege recognised by law.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.3 Opt-Out Procedure.&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (&ldquo;OPT-OUT&rdquo;) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (&ldquo;OPT-OUT NOTICE&rdquo;). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO GLASSDOOR LLC., C/O CT CORPORATION, ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 330 NORTH BRAND BOULEVARD, GLENDALE, CA 91203-2336.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For your convenience, we are providing an&nbsp;<a href="http://media.glassdoor.com/legal/Glassdoor-Arbitration-Opt-Out-Notice.pdf">Opt-Out Notice form</a>&nbsp;that you may use. Please make sure to include your name, address (street address, city, state, and zip code), and the email address(es) associated with the account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in section 12.2. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in this section, all other parts of these Terms and section 12 will continue to apply to you. Opting out of the agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may enter into or have entered into with us.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.4 Exceptions to Arbitration.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The agreement to arbitration provisions set forth in subparts 12.2.1 and 12.2.2 above will not apply to the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>small claims court cases that qualify for small claims status;</li>
<li>legal proceedings or procedures that involve efforts to obtain personal data related to a user or users, including but not limited to the author of any Glassdoor Content or review;</li>
<li>any legal proceedings brought against any of the Glassdoor Group by companies or other legal entities, or individuals acting on behalf of such companies or other legal entities;</li>
<li>any legal proceedings brought by any of the Glassdoor Group against companies or other legal entities, or individuals acting on behalf of any such companies or other legal entities; and</li>
<li>a party&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>any claim for public injunctive relief, which must be adjudicated in court, not by the arbitrator. If either party seeks public injunctive relief, that request for relief shall be severed from any arbitration proceeding and stayed pending a final resolution of the arbitration, at which point the claim may be adjudicated.</li>
<li>any claim not already subject to one of the exceptions listed in section 12.2.4 where any or all of the non-Glassdoor Group parties are located outside of the United States.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, for some reason, the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in section 12 cannot be enforced, then the entirety of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in subparts 12.2.1-3 will not apply; the remainder of section 12 will continue to apply.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.5 Governing Law and Venue.</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For claims subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4, these Terms and any and all claims, disputes, or other legal proceedings by or between you or us, including but not limited to any such claims or disputes that are in any way related to or arising under these Terms or your access to or use of our services, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may otherwise provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. These claims or disputes shall be brought and litigated exclusively in the state courts located within Marin County, California or the federal courts in the Northern District of California, as appropriate, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of each of these courts for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.</li>
<li>For all claims not subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4, the parties agree that their arrangement under these Terms is in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies to the construction of the agreement to arbitrate provisions set forth in section 12.2.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.6 Changes To The Agreement To Arbitrate</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We will notify you of changes to section 12 by posting the changes at least 30 days before the effective date of the changes and by notice to the email address associated with your account. It is therefore essential that you keep your email address up to date. You can update your email address from your accounts settings page.</li>
<li>If you do not agree to the changed terms, you may close your account within the 30 day period and you will not be bound by these changes. Otherwise, if you continue to use our services, the changed terms will apply to all disputes or claims governed by this section 12 that have arisen or may arise between you and Glassdoor which are initiated after the time the changed terms take effect.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any changes to section 12 (other than a change to any referenced notice address or site links) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding prior to the effective date of the change.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.1 Using Glassdoor Services</h3>
<p>Glassdoor offers a variety of services that may change from time to time, at our sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Whether or not you&rsquo;ve set up an account on our services, if you use our services we may process your personal data. We describe how we may use your personal data in our&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/glassdoor">Privacy Policy</a>. This includes personal data we use to offer or provide our services to you, our customers, other users, and the public, as well as to manage and improve our services.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We may offer you the ability to create and/or join groups to have conversations and create communities with other users (also known as &ldquo;bowls&rdquo;). Groups may have managers or leaders (also known as &ldquo;community&rdquo; or &ldquo;bowl leaders&rdquo;) who have access to additional features for managing their groups (e.g., the ability to pin or highlight Content or approve new members). Leading a group is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the services. We are not responsible for actions taken by group leaders.

If you have any reason to think your application was not received by an employer, we suggest you contact them directly to confirm.</li>
<li>Glassdoor does not guarantee the identity of an employer or any individuals working for any employers, and therefore advises users to exercise caution when applying to jobs.

<li>Personalization of your Glassdoor experience may vary depending on how you use our services and if you have registered for an account. When available, we will use your location, your Profile, and your activity on our services (e.g., pages you view, Content you interact with, jobs you search for) to personalize your experience. To learn more about which information we collect and how we use it, please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://hrtechprivacy.com/brands/glassdoor">Privacy Policy</a>. You cannot opt out of or adjust these personalization features absent deleting your account or information from your Profile. The most important factors for personalization include your location and your Profile. We may use your personal information and activity to personalize:
<ul>
<li>The jobs we recommend to you or show you in search results;</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.2 Anonymity And Identity On Glassdoor</h3>
<p>Depending on the services you use, we may offer you different options for controlling how your personal data and identity are represented to other users, employers, and the public.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A portion of your Profile on our community and conversation services (e.g., Fishbowl and community and conversation features across our services) is always public. Therefore, your profile picture, company name, title, and other general information (but not including your semi-/anonymous Content submissions) will be visible to the public and available via search. Content submitted with semi-/anonymous identifiers such as your company name or job title is not associated with the publicly-visible portion of your Profile.</li>
<li>When you submit Content such as a post, comment, or question, you may be able to control how you represent yourself using different anonymity options. For example, when using some of our services, you can choose to submit Content with your company name, your job title, or your full name.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When submitting other Content, such as reviews, you may be required to include certain personal data for public display, such as your employer, job title, and/or location.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In some groups, we may allow you to make your Profile visible to other members of the group so you can interact with them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In some instances, we may allow group leaders to limit access to a group and approve new group members. When you request access to a group, your Profile and answers to member-approval questions may be shared with the leader(s) for that group.</li>
<li>We endeavor to offer opportunities to use our services while preserving your anonymity, However, you acknowledge that Glassdoor cannot guarantee your anonymity as, depending on your specific situation and circumstances and the contents of your Content, even semi-/anonymous identifiers, such as company or job title, especially when paired with other information such as your location, may allow someone to identify you or narrow down your identity to a small group of people (e.g., employees in a particular department at your company). You should understand this risk before submitting Content to the services.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4.3 House Rules&nbsp;</h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For your convenience, we are providing an&nbsp;<a href="http://media.glassdoor.com/legal/Glassdoor-Arbitration-Opt-Out-Notice.pdf">Opt-Out Notice form</a>&nbsp;that you may use. Please make sure to include your name, address (street address, city, state, and zip code), and the email address(es) associated with the account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in section 12.2. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in this section, all other parts of these Terms and section 12 will continue to apply to you. Opting out of the agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may enter into or have entered into with us.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.4 Exceptions to Arbitration.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The agreement to arbitration provisions set forth in subparts 12.2.1 and 12.2.2 above will not apply to the following:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>small claims court cases that qualify for small claims status;</li>
<li>legal proceedings or procedures that involve efforts to obtain personal data related to a user or users, including but not limited to the author of any Glassdoor Content or review;</li>
<li>any legal proceedings brought against any of the Glassdoor Group by companies or other legal entities, or individuals acting on behalf of such companies or other legal entities;</li>
<li>any legal proceedings brought by any of the Glassdoor Group against companies or other legal entities, or individuals acting on behalf of any such companies or other legal entities; and</li>
<li>a party&rsquo;s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>any claim for public injunctive relief, which must be adjudicated in court, not by the arbitrator. If either party seeks public injunctive relief, that request for relief shall be severed from any arbitration proceeding and stayed pending a final resolution of the arbitration, at which point the claim may be adjudicated.</li>
<li>any claim not already subject to one of the exceptions listed in section 12.2.4 where any or all of the non-Glassdoor Group parties are located outside of the United States.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, for some reason, the prohibition on class arbitrations set forth in section 12 cannot be enforced, then the entirety of the agreement to arbitrate set forth in subparts 12.2.1-3 will not apply; the remainder of section 12 will continue to apply.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.5 Governing Law and Venue.</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For claims subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4, these Terms and any and all claims, disputes, or other legal proceedings by or between you or us, including but not limited to any such claims or disputes that are in any way related to or arising under these Terms or your access to or use of our services, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may otherwise provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. These claims or disputes shall be brought and litigated exclusively in the state courts located within Marin County, California or the federal courts in the Northern District of California, as appropriate, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of each of these courts for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.</li>
<li>For all claims not subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart 12.2.4, the parties agree that their arrangement under these Terms is in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies to the construction of the agreement to arbitrate provisions set forth in section 12.2.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12.2.6 Changes To The Agreement To Arbitrate</h4>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We will notify you of changes to section 12 by posting the changes at least 30 days before the effective date of the changes and by notice to the email address associated with your account.

<li>If you do not agree to the changed terms, you may close your account within the 30 day period and you will not be bound by these changes. Otherwise, if you continue to use our services, the changed terms will apply to all disputes or claims governed by this section 12 that have arisen or may arise between you and Glassdoor which are initiated after the time the changed terms take effect.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any changes to section 12 (other than a change to any referenced notice address or site links) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding prior to the effective date of the change.</li>
